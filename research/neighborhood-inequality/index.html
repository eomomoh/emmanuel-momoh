    <p>
      At the Neighborhood Inequality Lab, I contribute to research on how environmental and social inequalities shape urban heat exposure. 
      I collaborate with an interdisciplinary team to study the intersection of urban heat exposure, mobility patterns, and socioeconomic disparities, using geospatial and statistical analysis to reveal 
      how risks are unevenly distributed across neighborhoods.

    <h2>Duties</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Conduct spatial analysis of heat exposure across neighborhoods using R, integrating temperature data with socioeconomic indicators such as income, race/ethnicity, age, disability status, and car ownership.</li>
      <li>Integrate canopy cover data to evaluate its role in mitigating urban heat disparities.</li>
      <li>Analyze SafeGraph cell phone data to assess how neighborhood-level travel patterns affect individual and community heat exposure.</li>
      <li>Perform statistical modeling to identify correlations between mobility behavior and differential heat risks.</li>
      <li>Visualize spatial patterns and disparities using GIS tools and data visualization techniques for academic presentations.</li>
      <li>Collaborate with interdisciplinary team members to interpret findings and shape community-informed heat resilience strategies.</li>
    </ul>
